# Weekly Check-In (Week 10)
### Write-up

#### 1. what you’d hoped to accomplish for this week (i.e., a recap of your goals from the  previous week and your initial proposal) 
###### This week, my aim was to integrate the calendar view into the app's design and implement basic functionalities. This involved enabling users to view dates and navigate between months.

#### 2. what you did accomplish for this week, including an assessment of what went faster or  slower than you thought it would 
###### I achieved all set goals this week within a reasonable timeframe. There were some unexpected issues with the iPhone simulator which slowed progress a bit, but I was able to get the calendar to display correctly.

#### 3. what you hope to accomplish for next week
###### Next week, I’d like to focus on adding medication events to the calendar view. Users will be able to add, edit, and delete medication events. Additionally, I added a new goal to prioritize displaying the current date's medication schedule upon opening the app, with the option to switch to the calendar view if needed.
